## What is Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that users can automate the deployment of the applications, scale, manage, upgrade in a secured way.
In general terms according to me we can think Kubernetes is like a "Railway station" which contains multiple platforms called as "nodes" in Kubernetes and the scheduling of applications on the nodes can be treated as schedling different trains to different platforms (PF1, PF2 etc) based on certain criteria.
